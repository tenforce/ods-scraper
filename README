= Getting started with the ODS scraper =

This document describes how to install and set up the ODS scraper.


== Installation ==

First install python 2.7.  Then install scrapy. See 
http://scrapy.org/download/ for more information.


== Build your spider ==

In order to build a spider, copy the ods/spiders/spider-example.py file
to a file of your choice in the ods/spiders folder.  The file extension
must be .py.


== Run the spider ==

Each spider has a name.  The name of the spider is supplied in the
spider class.  Assuming your spider is called myOdsSpider, launch
the spider by calling:

```
  scrapy crawl spiderName
```

or add the name of your spider to the relevant list in scrape-eba.sh
and launch all selected spiders.
